Resume Project - 2

Ran a Multivariable Regression based on the previous data available, after splitting it.

Evaluate our model's coefficients and residuals.

Use data transformation to improve our model performance and estimate a property price.

Evaluate our regression based on the sign of its coefficients and improve a regression model using (a log) data transformation.
